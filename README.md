# plotly-challenge

For this challenge I was able to correctly display a Demographic Info box with data from the metadata, a Horizontal Bar Chart and an interactive Bubble Chart using the top ten OTU sample data for each id patient.  I was also able to successfully input a Gauge Chart using the Washing Frequency data. I did not use the one showed in the homework example, however I referenced Plotly documentation to input a Basic Gauge Chart.  When a selection is made from the dropdown menu, all charts update with the appropriate data and visualization.  All codes are written in the app.js file including the Bonus Gauge Chart.
